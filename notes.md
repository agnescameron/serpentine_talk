### notes

thinking about tools, how one interfaces to work 

1. talk is roughly divided into 3 parts:
* I talk about some of my work
* why it looks the way it does
* expand a bit on interfaces 

talk in 3 small parts, about my own work, and about some ideas about artificial intelligence I like, then i try and relate them a little

surprised when asked about interfaces — I think of myself as someone that make some interfaces, when I need to, like for web design work, but not my core activity — I identify with the backend

even when I do work on web interfaces, they look a lot like terminals

2. fud - work w gary zhang, 

3. 

The next few examples are backend interfaces that I've made for myself to work on projects
all of them deal w/ artificial 'intelligence', the 3rd is machine learning

4. first up: slime moulds

dissertation project

5. next: artificial society

a more recent example of swarm simulation w/ my friend Owen Trueblood, in collaboration with artist Agnieszka Kurant on what turned into her artwork Conversions. artificial society piece.

based on sugarscape social simulation

6. lastly, a slightly more trad 'ml' example

MOZILLA
good sequence:
where are you?
potato
beep beep
why are you playing this?
are you a bot?
you’re a bot
I didn’t ask you
what’s your fave colour
get bent


making interfaces — tools — are about making your life easier —  a lot of it is anticipating the tasks you’re going to find yourself repeating, lines of code you're always going to be changing, or information that you’re always going to be looking for. the simplest is just adding print statements to code! an interface is just a form of information-mediation, intelligence is about interfacing

aesthetic sensibility of terminal interfaces quite particular. ssh-keygen screen, ascii art. used to be the only way to interact with a computer, remains one of the quickest and most flexible ways to interact. 

point of pride in ‘understanding’ machines, and a kind of competitive macho-element in demonstrating one’s proximity to machine functioning. performative aspect for sure. rarely working on projects by myself, but when i am, or with people I’l close to, i include small jokes. something about in-jokes. 

but there is also something else going on! one thing I like to think about w/ synthetic intelligence... talking to a computer on its own terms.

talk about pfeifer

introspecting on why i like terminals. closer to how a computer ‘understands’ itself, a way of seeing from its point of view
